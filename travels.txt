My favorite travel expoerence was in Venice Italy. I had the chance to go and expierence one of the most relaxing cities in the world with my family. The culture is so unique and the food was exquisite. You will never find a place with more fresh seafood or wine. 
Italy was the birthplace of some of the most creative minds in the world. I was able to see some of Michelangelo's famous works of art and design.
If you ever have the chance to expierence this city before it sinks, you should not hesitate to go.
